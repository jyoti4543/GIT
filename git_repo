Creating a GIT Repository

- GIT is a distributed version control system meaning you can have a local copy of project files to work individually and then push it to the remote repository

- To create a local git repo, we need below steps

1. Create an empty directory
2. use command "git init" to intialise git -- that creates your git repo . The hidden .git folder will contain all the metadata of GIT and .git is responsible for tracking changes.

- A repository can be a place to store things, a person who contains a lot of information, or a centralized digital storage for developers
