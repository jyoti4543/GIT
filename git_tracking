Tracking changes between the stages

- git diff filename ----> is used to track changes in file between the working directory and the staging area

- git diff --staged -----> is used to track the changes between the staging area and the local repo

- git diff HEAD is similar to the git diff --staged

- the latest commit is represantated by a pointer called HEAD . The last second commit is pointed by HEAD~1 and so on

- when there are multiple commits , we cannot refer by HEAD , so at that time we use hash codes or commit ids
